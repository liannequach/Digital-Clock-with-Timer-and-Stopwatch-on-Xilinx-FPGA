# Smart-Lock
The goal of this project is to implement a
configurable digital clock on an FPGA. The main
components of this project will be a Verilog module that
will output to the board to show the time in either
military or standard format and a seven-segment display
which is built into the FPGA Nexys A7 100T will show
the time on the board. Using the features of the FPGA,
the clock will switch from standard to military time or
vice versa, flash LEDs, set the time, and have stopwatch
and timer functions.
